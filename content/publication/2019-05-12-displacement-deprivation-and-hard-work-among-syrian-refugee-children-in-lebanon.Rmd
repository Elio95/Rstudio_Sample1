abstract: Background The protracted Syrian war resulted in the
largest refugee crisis of our time. The most vulnerable are
children who face separation from parents, interruption of
schooling and child labour. This study explores the living
and working conditions of Syrian children in Lebanon.
Methods In this cross-sectional study, we randomly
selected 153 informal tented settlements and
conducted interviewer-administered surveys among
Syrian refugee working children in the Bekaa Valley in
Lebanon. Those aged 8–18 completed a questionnaire
on sociodemographic and occupational characteristics;
those aged 4–8 years were surveyed through a household
questionnaire
